This code handles the detection of piano keys (black and white) on an image, associates them with musical notes, and detects which key was clicked. Here's a breakdown of each part:

### 1. **Mapping Notes to Contours**

The notes for both white and black keys are predefined and stored in lists:

```python
notes_sequence_white = ['C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A', 'B']
notes_sequence_white = notes_sequence_white[::-1]  # Reverse the sequence

notes_sequence_black = ['C#', 'D#', 'F#', 'G#', 'A#']
notes_sequence_black = notes_sequence_black[::-1]  # Reverse the sequence
```

- The white keys are mapped to the notes `C, D, E, F, G, A, B` (reversed).
- The black keys are mapped to the notes `C#, D#, F#, G#, A#` (reversed).

The reversal ensures that the notes are correctly aligned when drawn on the image.

### 2. **Function: `getKeyWithNote()`**

This function associates each contour (key) with its corresponding note and draws the keys on the image.

```python
def getKeyWithNote(contoursBlack, contoursWhite, image):
    keys_with_notes = []
    
    # Draw the black keys
    for i, contour in enumerate(contoursBlack):
        x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)  # Get the bounding box of the contour
        note = notes_sequence_black[i % len(notes_sequence_black)]  # Map the note using index
        # Draw a red rectangle for the black key
        cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 0, 255), 2)
        # Add the note text above the key
        cv2.putText(image, note, (x, y - 25), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.9, (0, 0, 255), 2)
        # Append the note and rectangle information to the list
        keys_with_notes.append({'note': note, 'rect': (x, y, w, h), 'type': 'black'})
    
    # Draw the white keys
    for i, contour in enumerate(contoursWhite):
        x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)  # Get the bounding box of the contour
        note = notes_sequence_white[i % len(notes_sequence_white)]  # Map the note using index
        # Draw a green rectangle for the white key
        cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
        # Add the note text above the key
        cv2.putText(image, note, (x, y - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.9, (36, 255, 12), 2)
        # Append the note and rectangle information to the list
        keys_with_notes.append({'note': note, 'rect': (x, y, w, h), 'type': 'white'})
    
    return keys_with_notes
```

- **Black Keys**: For each black key contour, a red rectangle is drawn around the key, and the corresponding note (from `notes_sequence_black`) is placed above the rectangle. Each key is stored in the `keys_with_notes` list with its note, bounding box (rectangle), and type ('black').
  
- **White Keys**: Similarly, a green rectangle is drawn for each white key, and the corresponding note (from `notes_sequence_white`) is placed above it. The key data is stored in the same list.

- **Output**: The function returns a list (`keys_with_notes`) where each element is a dictionary containing:
  - `note`: The musical note associated with the key.
  - `rect`: The bounding rectangle `(x, y, w, h)` for detecting clicks.
  - `type`: Whether the key is 'black' or 'white'.

### 3. **Function: `find_clicked_key()`**

This function determines which key was clicked based on the coordinates of the mouse click.

```python
def find_clicked_key(x_click, y_click, keys_with_notes):
    keys = []
    for key in keys_with_notes:
        x, y, w, h = key['rect']  # Get the bounding rectangle of the key
        if x <= x_click <= x + w and y <= y_click <= y + h:  # Check if the click is within the rectangle
            keys.append(key)  # Add the key to the list if it was clicked
    
    # If multiple keys are clicked (e.g., overlapping white and black keys)
    if len(keys) >= 1:
        for key in keys:
            if key['note'] == 'black':  # Prioritize black keys
                return key['note']
        return keys[0]['note']  # Return the first white key if no black key is clicked
    else:
        return None  # Return None if no key was clicked
```

- **Click Detection**: For each key, the function checks if the `(x_click, y_click)` coordinates fall within the bounding rectangle of the key.
  
- **Multiple Keys**: If more than one key was clicked (for example, when a black key overlaps a white key), the function prioritizes the black key. If no black key was clicked, it returns the first white key.
  
- **Return**: The function returns the note of the clicked key or `None` if no key was clicked.

### Summary

- **`getKeyWithNote()`** detects and labels the piano keys in the image, associating each key (black or white) with a note and drawing rectangles around them.
- **`find_clicked_key()`** detects which key (black or white) was clicked based on mouse click coordinates and returns the associated note.

Together, these functions allow for interactive piano key detection, visualizing the keys on the screen, and playing the correct sound when a key is clicked.
